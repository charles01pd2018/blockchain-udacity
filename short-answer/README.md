# What Excites You About the Blockchain?
Blockchain excites me because it's questioning the foundation and infrastructure of the internet. It’s showing that there could be a better method to store and share data digitally. At the moment, there are still so many applications of the blockchain that haven’t been fully explored yet. Those possibilities excite me. No doubt as the technology matures, applications of the blockchain will narrow as various use cases are tried and tested to see which might fit the best. But as of now, the exploration of what the blockchain can accomplish is super fun to think about.

Use cases that I am most bullish on:

Supply Chain
I think the blockchain database and decentralized network structure pairs extremely well with the supply chain and models out the structure of it perfectly. Because there are various parties at play within the supply chain, decentralization just makes sense. No one party should be responsible for managing the data. How goods are transferred from one party to another mimic transactions on the blockchain as each transport is dependent on its previous transfer. Blockchain would promote integrity, security, and efficiency for the supply chain.

Also IoT and Identity!

# Pretend you are starting a blockchain and had to choose one of these Consensus Models. Explore the pros and cons. Write up a proposal convincing others to use this protocol. We've linked a few resources below that you can use to begin exploring.
I would opt for DBFT ( Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance ). The reasons are the following:

## Encouraging Network Participation
Many times, even in the POS consensus model, it is very difficult for many users to act as network participants because of the barrier to entry from a resources perspective. As a result, many "Decentralized" networks get concentrated into the hands of very large players (usually companies). Utilizing DBFT enables some sort of voting power for all users to take advantage of.

## Power in the Majority
POS falls short because it enables users with big wallets to essentially control the network. However, the more people that are able to delegate there tokens to a trusted speaker distributes power across network participants.

Going into some cons now:

## Complicated
Understanding how consensus models to begin with is tough. Now we are introducing another role and subsequent layer to network participants. Can cause confusion and introduces complexity to the consensus protocol.

## Security / Untested
POW has been around the longest with Bitcoin since 2009, and the network has never been hacked or tampered with. For a currency of that scale to achieve that autonomosly is pretty impressive. The same can't be said about POS or BDFT.
