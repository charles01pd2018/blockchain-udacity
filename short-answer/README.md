# What Excites You About the Blockchain?
Blockchain excites me because it's questioning the foundation and infrastructure of the internet. It’s showing that there could be a better method to store and share data digitally. At the moment, there are still so many applications of the blockchain that haven’t been fully explored yet. Those possibilities excite me. No doubt as the technology matures, applications of the blockchain will narrow as various use cases are tried and tested to see which might fit the best. But as of now, the exploration of what the blockchain can accomplish is super fun to think about.

Use cases that I am most bullish on:

Supply Chain
I think the blockchain database and decentralized network structure pairs extremely well with the supply chain and models out the structure of it perfectly. Because there are various parties at play within the supply chain, decentralization just makes sense. No one party should be responsible for managing the data. How goods are transferred from one party to another mimic transactions on the blockchain as each transport is dependent on its previous transfer. Blockchain would promote integrity, security, and efficiency for the supply chain.

Also IoT and Identity!
